I am a Ph.D. student working with [Prof. Jia-Bin Huang](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/) in the [Vision and Learning Laboratory](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/people.html) at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech. I am funded by [Kuwait University](http://www.kuniv.edu.kw) for both my masters and Ph.D. study.
My research interests are in the area of computer vision and computer graphics. I am particularly interested in image synthesis. I am currently exploring approaches to realistic image editing and manipulation.

You can find my CV [here](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~Badour/personal/cv-badour.pdf).
